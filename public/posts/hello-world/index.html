      <p>I&rsquo;m Eileen Noonan. I&rsquo;m an <a href="https://eileenmnoonan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actress</a>. I&rsquo;m a writer. I&rsquo;m a computer programmer. I try to be a good friend, a good sister, a good daughter, a good aunt, a good person. I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll ever get to be a mother of any kind. I&rsquo;m transgender. First and foremost I am a human fucking being. Can we all be human beings?</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s a question that&rsquo;s been plaguing me lately. I believe having this outlet to process things will help me stop myself from uselessly doom-scrolling or falling into despair, but we&rsquo;ll see!</p>
<h2 id="being-trans">Being Trans <a href="#being-trans" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard. Trans women cling to each other because everywhere else in the world tends to seem to want to kick us out, if not hunt us down. We are constantly circling the wagons, constantly holding each other up. I am so blessed to have a close circle of trans girl friends and if I leave New York City having accomplished nothing apart from meeting these friends, it will have been worth it.</p>
<h2 id="being-an-actress">Being an Actress <a href="#being-an-actress" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s really hard. It&rsquo;s very difficult to find work, and the math makes one think that even <em>with</em> talent, landing a good role is about like winning a lottery ticket. I like to think I&rsquo;m good. I&rsquo;ve worked with some brilliant teachers. Time will tell if that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being brief about acting here because if I really dig into it, it will all come out in a torrent of emotion. I love it so much, and sometimes I think it&rsquo;s a disease, to have this passion, this existential dread that creeps up on me when I&rsquo;m not somehow moving forward. I don&rsquo;t know if I will ever be as good as I want to be. I badly want to tell stories, embody stories, make people <em>feel something</em>.<em>CONNECT</em>. But it&rsquo;s a hard skill to master and a hard world in which to master it.</p>
<h1 id="being-a-programmer">Being a Programmer <a href="#being-a-programmer" class="anchor"></a></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a web developer for over ten years now, with some time taken off to focus on acting training. It&rsquo;s been a good career for me. I enjoy challenging programming projects, and I enjoy learning new things and new technologies. Most of my bread and butter work is in PHP, though. Wordpress and Laravel. But I&rsquo;m learning Go and Rust because I just really want to be able to use these languages that compile to a freakin&rsquo; binary that you can just <em>run</em>. I love the idea of being able to serve 10,000 requests per second even if I may never work on a project with that level of traffic. I just think it&rsquo;s freakin&rsquo; COOL and computers are COOL. All that is why I&rsquo;m building this site with the <a href="gohugo.io">Hugo</a> static site generator and the <a href="neovim.io">NeoVim</a> text editor - I just like to try new things.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence <a href="#artificial-intelligence" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming for us all. It certainly has its sights set on my acting profession and my coding profession. We&rsquo;ll see. Maybe I should have learned to be an electrician or a plumber. I have studied some fundamentals of how AI works, built little neural nets from scratch, fine tuned a few models, and even &ldquo;animated&rdquo; the protagonist of my friend&rsquo;s novel with some fine-tuning and retrieval augmented magic. I can&rsquo;t be too afraid of AI because a) it will actualy bring a lot of good things and b) the bad things are either overblown or like an oncoming meteor for which there is no way to prepare. Climate change worries me a lot more than AI.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future <a href="#the-future" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>I worry about it all the time. It drives me to distraction. It pulls me out of the present moment. I end up doom-scrolling instead of building good healthy habits. I&rsquo;d like to start meditating and working out. I&rsquo;d like to inject some discipline and structure into my life - but that&rsquo;s always been difficult. I think I have ADHD or something, but the doctor has me on Zoloft. Ah well.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion <a href="#in-conclusion" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m feeling a little bit depressed. I&rsquo;m tired of sharing my thoughts on platforms like Threads and X, platforms that are just going to go away. So I want to start making a blog I can feel I have some ownership over. And that starts here, now, in this small way. I turned 40 this year and I feel I have very little to show for it. I feel I have great untapped and unrecognized potential. But I&rsquo;ve been feeling that way for so long, and I know so many others who feel the same way. I fear we have entered the dark ages and I don&rsquo;t know how to respond to that other than to honestly say what I feel and how I perceive things.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, have the loveliest fucking day. Peace!</p>
